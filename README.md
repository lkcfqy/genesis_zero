# 🌌 Genesis: Artificial Life & Neuroevolution Simulation 🧬

**Genesis** is an adorable yet powerful experimental project that explores the origins of machine intelligence! ✨ It doesn't just program intelligence; it programs the "laws of evolution" itself. Through 6 progressive evolutionary stages, you can watch cute little agents evolve from basic logical units into advanced groups capable of spatial awareness, memory, game strategy, and tribal cooperation! 🥰

> *"Intelligence is not designed; it emerges under the pressure of survival."* 🌱

## 📂 Project Structure & Evolutionary Stages 🚀

This project contains 6 core scripts, each representing a milestone in AI evolution. It is highly recommended to run them in order to witness the magic! 🪄

### 🌟 Stage 0: The Spark (`main.py`)
* **Goal**: Solve the classic XOR logic problem.
* **Core Concept**: **Self-Modifying Architecture** 🛠️
* **Mechanism**: When the minimalist neural network gets stuck, it performs "brain surgery" on itself by adding hidden layers or neurons! 🧠✂️

### 🦋 Stage 1: Neural Society (`genesis_one.py`)
* **Goal**: Survival of the fittest in a pure logic world.
* **Core Concept**: **Natural Selection** 🧬
* **Mechanism**: Only agents that solve the XOR puzzle get energy to reproduce and pass their brain structures to the next generation! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

### 🍖 Stage 2: Hunting Grounds (`genesis_two.py`)
* **Goal**: Spatial awareness and autonomous foraging.
* **Core Concept**: **Embodied Intelligence** 🏃‍♂️
* **Mechanism**: Agents enter a 2D Pygame world! They must learn to move and find green food (🍏) to survive and evolve complex brains.

### 🌲 Stage 3: Dark Forest (`genesis_three.py`)
* **Goal**: Memory and survival games.
* **Core Concept**: **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/GRU)** 🔄
* **Mechanism**: Agents gain "memory" to process sequences. It's a cruel world where they must decide whether to hunt weaker peers or flee from stronger ones! 🐺💨

### ⚖️ Stage 4: Autonomous Evolution (`genesis_four.py`)
* **Goal**: Self-design and dynamic environmental balance.
* **Core Concept**: **Brain Plasticity & Homeostasis** 🧘‍♀️
* **Mechanism**: Agents choose their evolutionary path: "see clearer" or "remember more". An Auto-Balancer adjusts food spawn rates based on population density to prevent extinction! 🌍

### ⚔️ Stage 5: Tribal Wars (`genesis_five.py`)
* **Goal**: Communication, language, and group cooperation.
* **Core Concept**: **Social Behavior** 🤝
* **Mechanism**: Agents are divided into Red 🔴 and Blue 🔵 tribes. They must communicate to identify teammates and work together to hunt giant Mammoths (🦣) for massive energy!

python genesis_five.py

```

### 3. Pygame UI Guide 🎮

In the graphical interfaces for Stages 2-5:

* **Red/Blue Squares**: Our cute Agents! Colors/borders indicate their energy, generation, or tribe.
* **Green Squares**: Yummy Food! 🍏
* **Purple Squares**: Big Mammoths (Stage 5 only) 🦣.
* **UI Info**: Top-left corner displays Population (Pop), Max Generation (Gen), and environmental stats! 📊
